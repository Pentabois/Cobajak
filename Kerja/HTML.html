    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1> 
<h2>Chapter 1</h2> 
<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying
between the copies 
of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work 
had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been 
Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more 
she felt she needed to be free.</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscar
Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to 
do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama 
<abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly 
<em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
